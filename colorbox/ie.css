/*
    The following fixes png-transparency for IE6.  
    It is also necessary for png-transparency in IE7 & IE8 to avoid 'black halos' with the fade transition
    
    Since this method does not support CSS background-positioning, it is incompatible with CSS sprites.
    Colorbox preloads navigation hover classes to account for this.
    
    !! Important Note: AlphaImageLoader src paths are relative to the HTML document,
    while regular CSS background images are relative to the CSS document.
